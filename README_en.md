#### Discord [![](https://img.shields.io/discord/720789890354249748?logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=4e4c97)](https://discord.gg/AQN6GeJ) QQ Group ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/QQ%20Group-1087735381-4e4c97)

Alas, an Azur Lane automation tool with GUI (Supports CN, EN, JP, TW, able to support other servers), designed for 24/7 running scenes, can take over almost all Azur Lane gameplay. Azur Lane, as a mobile game, has entered the late stage of its life cycle. During the period from now to the server down, please reduce the time spent on the Azur Lane and leave everything to Alas.

EN support, thanks **[@whoamikyo](https://github.com/whoamikyo)** and **[@nEEtdo0d](https://github.com/nEEtdo0d)**.

JP support, thanks **[@ferina8-14](https://github.com/ferina8-14)**, **[@noname94](https://github.com/noname94)** and **[@railzy](https://github.com/railzy)**.

[Map detection](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript/wiki/perspective_en)

The core of an Azur Lane bot is map detection. If you simply use `Template matching` to search enemies, will encounter situation that mob enemies block the boss. Alas provide a better map detection method. In `module.map_detection`, you will be able to access full map data, like this.
